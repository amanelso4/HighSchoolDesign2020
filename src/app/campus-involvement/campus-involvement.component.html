        succeed in this industry. He taught us about finite state machines, Alan Turing, and so many other different

        did more exercises in our lab section and I definitely feel as though this helped me learn the required material
        more in depth and more easily because I had more practice with real-world application.</td>

        version I was in a more strenuous curriculum and I was able to learn more about proof and the fundamental
        theorem of linear algebra.</td>
